# Pointers

A summary of what are the pointers video i watched, as I understand it.

#
A POINTER IS JUST A VARIABLE THAT HOLDS A MEMORY ADDRESS
#

# The topics of my summary
basics of pointers, pointers of array, getting addresses and values of certain locations in memory,
doing pointer arithmetic, role of pointers play in polymorphism, smart pointers - shared - multiple accessors to pointer,
smart pointers - unique - only ever one accessor to pointer

## DIRECT ADDRESSING

1-We take a symbol and it directly corresponds to a location in the RAM.

## INDIRECT ADDRESSING

(**ORANGE**)2-When we we use ampersand(&) symbol, it gets the address of variable used together and to say b is a pointer we include the asterix symbol(\*).  
(**GREEN**)3-If we want to get value from the location pointed by variable, we use asterix operator(\*). This means get the value at the location pointed to by variable.

## TYPE OF DATA
